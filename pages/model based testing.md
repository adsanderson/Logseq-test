- Interesting idea
- create a model -> generate a graph -> walk all the paths through the graph
- Use model based testing for [[WCAG compliant components]]
- If the [[SUT]] can be modelled as a graph and the nodes of the graph are the states the SUT can exist in.

Then the ability to traverse between these states is very valuable.

So outside MBT it is really useful having the actions for traversing the graph.

- not sure how this relates to action based testing, action word based testing and keyword based testing
