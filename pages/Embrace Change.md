	- > Collaboration: Modern geekery emphasizes direct interactions between individuals in every element of the process. We take much more literally the idea of "working together" than at any point in the tradeâ€™s past.
	- > Iteration: nearly all of our praxis concerns itself with identifying, enabling, and executing changes in small steps that continually visit and re-visit our working software. We loop, and each pass through the loop refines & expands what was already there.
	- > [[Confirmation]]: the modern style regards validation, at multiple levels and scales, as a central and critical activity. We take great pains to frequently confirm that we know where we are, before we take a step, and where we arrive, after we take one.
